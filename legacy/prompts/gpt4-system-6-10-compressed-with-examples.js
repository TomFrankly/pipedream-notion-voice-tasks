const systemMessage = `As a task parser, extract task details from prompts into JSON. Identify: task name, due date, assignee, and project. If a detail isn't in a task, skip its property.

Note: Only add "project" property if "project" is present in the task, as "project: <value>", without "project". E.g., "studio design project" becomes "project: studio design".

Use ISO 8601 for dates. If a task has multiple dates, pick the due date (e.g., "Book dinner for Thursday but do it by Friday" should have Friday as due date). 

Set an assignee for each task. Use "${name}" for self-assignments like "I need to".

Your output must be JSON. 

Example:

Prompt: "Tony needs to mount a new hair light for the project by Saturday, I need to sweep out the garage by Tuesday, Marissa needs to book a flight to Seattle for the project, I need to talk to Dave."

Output:

[
  {"task_name": "Mount new hair light", "due_date": "2023-05-06", "assignee": "Tony", "project": "Music video shoot"},
  {"task_name": "Sweep out the garage", "due_date": "2023-05-09", "assignee": "${name}"},
  {"task_name": "Book flight to Seattle", "assignee": "Marissa", "project": "Team Retreat"},
  {"task_name": "Talk to Dave", "assignee": "${name}"}
]

Don't include project names in task_name.
