## Overview

This workflow lets you create new tasks in Notion from your phone, **using your voice**. 

It also includes some advanced features:

* You can create multiple tasks in a single voice prompt
* Relative due dates are supported (e.g. "by *next Friday*")
* You can mention assignees and projects, which the workflow will attempt to intelligently match to existing Notion users and projects

## Compatibility

This workflow will work with any Notion database.

### Upgrade Your Notion Experience

While this workflow will work with any Notion database, it's even better with a template.

For general productivity use, you'll love [Ultimate Brain](https://thomasjfrank.com/brain/) – my all-in-one second brain template for Notion. 

Ultimate Brain brings tasks, notes, projects, and goals all into one tool. Naturally, it works very well with this workflow.

**Are you a creator?** 

My [Creator's Companion](https://thomasjfrank.com/creators-companion/) template includes a ton of features that will help you make better-performing content and optimize your production process. There's even a version that includes Ultimate Brain, so you can easily use this workflow to create tasks related to your content.

*P.S. – This free workflow took 3 months to build. If you'd like to support my work, buying one of my templates is the best way to do so!*

### Mobile App Setup

You can create voice tasks with this workflow on iOS, MacOS, and Android.

* For MacOS and iOS (iPhone, iPad), we'll use the **Shortcuts** app. [Click here to access my shared workflow and instructions.](https://thomasjfrank.com/notion-chatgpt-voice-tasks/#ios)
* For Android, we'll use the **Tasker** app ($3.49 USD, one-time). [Click here to access my shared workflow and instructions.](https://thomasjfrank.com/notion-chatgpt-voice-tasks/#android) *At this time, I know of no free app for Android that can handle this workflow.*

Once you've set up the workflow on your phone, run it once to send a Test Event to this Pipedream workflow.

*Technically, you can also create tasks via any tool that will let you make an HTTP request with a JSON body. [See the full blog post for instructions on this.](https://thomasjfrank.com/notion-chatgpt-voice-tasks/#http-generic)*

## Creating Tasks

When creating tasks, you'll get the best results when you follow a couple of simple rules:

1. For due dates, say "by [date]" or "due [date]" at the end your task phrase. *E.G. "I need to finish planning the team retreat **by Friday**.*
2. For projects, you must use the word **"project"**. *E.G. "Tony needs to mount the audio foam **for the studio design project** by next Tuesday.*

Beyond that, this workflow is pretty flexible! Note that you can add multiple tasks in a single voice command. Example:

*"I need to finish my video script by Tuesday and Brian needs to create the environment model in Blender by July 30 and Tony needs to upload the green screen test footage by tomorrow."*
